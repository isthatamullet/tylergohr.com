# Scratchpad Archive System

## 📁 Archive Structure

This directory contains completed scratchpads organized by year and type for easy reference and knowledge retrieval.

```
docs/scratchpad/archive/
├── README.md              # This guide
├── 2025/                  # Current year archives
│   ├── investigations/    # Completed bug investigations and debugging
│   ├── experiments/       # Completed code experiments and prototypes  
│   └── planning/          # Completed architecture and feature planning
└── [future-years]/        # Archive expansion by year
```

## 🎯 Purpose

The archive system provides:
- **Historical Reference**: Access to all completed development work
- **Knowledge Reuse**: Find similar solutions from previous implementations
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify successful approaches and methodologies
- **Project Timeline**: Track development evolution and decisions over time
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain complete implementation history

## 🔄 Archival Workflow

### When to Archive
- ✅ **Implementation Complete**: Code merged to production
- ✅ **Issue Resolved**: Bug fixed and validated
- ✅ **Experiment Concluded**: Results documented and decisions made
- ✅ **Planning Finalized**: Architecture approved and implemented

### How to Archive
1. **Complete the Scratchpad**: Fill in final results and completion summary
2. **Update Status**: Change status to "✅ Complete | 📋 Documentation Archived"
3. **Move to Archive**: Transfer from active directory to appropriate archive location
4. **Update References**: Ensure any linked issues/PRs reference the archived location

### Archive Naming Convention
```
[original-filename]  # Keep original name for consistency
```

## 📊 Archive Categories

### **Investigations** (`investigations/`)
Completed bug investigations, debugging sessions, and problem-solving work:
- Issue resolution processes
- Root cause analysis documentation  
- Testing methodologies and results
- Performance optimization studies

### **Experiments** (`experiments/`)
Completed code experiments, prototypes, and technology evaluations:
- New technology assessments
- Code pattern explorations
- Performance benchmarking
- Feature prototype validations

### **Planning** (`planning/`)
Completed architecture planning, feature design, and strategic documents:
- System architecture decisions
- Feature specification development
- Technical roadmap planning
- Integration strategy documentation

## 🔍 Finding Archived Content

### By Date
```bash
# Find all archives from specific month
find docs/scratchpad/archive/2025/ -name "*2025-06*"

# Find recent archives (last 30 days)
find docs/scratchpad/archive/ -type f -mtime -30
```

### By Topic
```bash
# Search for navigation-related archives
grep -r "navigation" docs/scratchpad/archive/

# Search for specific technology
grep -r "puppeteer" docs/scratchpad/archive/
```

### By Implementation Results
```bash
# Find successful optimizations
grep -r "optimization.*success" docs/scratchpad/archive/

# Find performance improvements
grep -r "performance.*improvement" docs/scratchpad/archive/
```

## 📈 Archive Metrics

Track archival patterns to understand development efficiency:
- **Resolution Time**: From problem identification to archive
- **Solution Reuse**: How often archived solutions inform new work
- **Knowledge Growth**: Archive volume and complexity over time
- **Pattern Recognition**: Recurring issues and their solutions

## 🚀 Integration with Development Workflow

### GitHub Integration
- Archived scratchpads linked from relevant PRs and issues
- Issue closure references archive location for future reference
- PR descriptions include links to investigation archives

### /implement Command Integration
- Automatic archival step in implementation completion
- Prior art research includes archive search
- Completion workflow updates scratchpad and moves to archive

### Knowledge Management
- Regular review of archived content for pattern identification
- Archive content used for onboarding and training materials
- Historical context for architectural decisions and trade-offs
