# Claude Code Slash Commands - Workflow Automation Exploration

**Date**: July 1, 2025  
**Purpose**: Design 3 new slash commands to automate common Claude Code workflows  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED & IMPLEMENTED

## Overview

Exploring implementation of 3 slash commands to streamline the most effective Claude Code workflows identified by Anthropic:

1. **`/explore-plan-commit`** - Systematic explore → plan → code → commit workflow
2. **`/tdd`** - Test-driven development workflow with commit checkpoints  
3. **`/visual-iterate`** - Visual mock-driven development with screenshot feedback

## Current Claude Code Slash Command Context

Claude Code currently supports several built-in slash commands:
- `/help` - Get help with Claude Code
- `/work-on` - Systematic task execution (already implemented)
- `/clear` - Clear conversation context

**Goal**: ✅ ACHIEVED - Extended system with workflow-specific automation commands.

### ✅ **Implementation Completed**
**Location**: All commands created in `.claude/commands/` directory
- **`/explore-plan-commit`** - `.claude/commands/explore-plan-commit.md`
- **`/tdd`** - `.claude/commands/tdd.md`  
- **`/visual-iterate`** - `.claude/commands/visual-iterate.md`

**Status**: Immediately available for use in Claude Code sessions

## 1. `/explore-plan-commit` Command Design

### **Purpose**
Automate the "Explore, plan, code, commit" workflow - the most versatile pattern for complex problems.

### **Command Syntax**
```bash
/explore-plan-commit "task description" [--thinking-level=think|think-hard|think-harder|ultrathink] [--skip-subagents]
```

### **Workflow Automation**

#### **Phase 1: Explore (Information Gathering)**
1. **Automatic Subagent Deployment**:
   - Deploy multiple subagents for parallel investigation
   - Auto-generate exploration queries based on task analysis
   - Gather relevant files, documentation, and context

2. **Context Synthesis**:
   - Consolidate subagent findings
   - Identify key constraints and requirements
   - Map existing codebase patterns and architecture

#### **Phase 2: Plan (Strategic Design)**
1. **Extended Thinking Activation**:
   - Apply specified thinking level (default: "think-hard")
   - Generate multiple solution approaches
   - Evaluate trade-offs and implementation complexity

2. **Plan Documentation**:
   - Auto-generate GitHub issue with detailed plan
   - Create implementation checklist with TodoWrite
   - Establish success criteria and testing approach

#### **Phase 3: Code (Implementation)**
1. **Systematic Implementation**:
   - Execute plan step-by-step with verification
   - Apply project-specific coding standards
   - Run quality gates at each milestone

2. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Update TodoWrite items in real-time
   - Provide implementation status updates
   - Handle blockers with adaptive re-planning

#### **Phase 4: Commit (Integration)**
1. **Quality Validation**:
   - Run comprehensive test suites
   - Validate against acceptance criteria
   - Ensure clean commit state

2. **Git Integration**:
   - Generate descriptive commit messages
   - Create pull request with context
   - Update documentation as needed

### **Implementation Considerations**
- **Error Recovery**: Handle failures gracefully with rollback options
- **User Interaction**: Prompt for approval at each major phase
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain conversation continuity across phases
- **Customization**: Allow workflow modifications per project needs

## 2. `/tdd` Command Design

### **Purpose**
Automate test-driven development workflow with clear test/code separation and commit checkpoints.

### **Command Syntax**
```bash
/tdd "feature description" [--test-framework=jest|playwright|vitest] [--test-pattern=unit|integration|e2e]
```

### **Workflow Automation**

#### **Phase 1: Test Design & Creation**
1. **Requirement Analysis**:
   - Parse feature requirements into testable behaviors
   - Identify input/output pairs and edge cases
   - Map to existing test patterns in codebase

2. **Test Generation**:
   - Create comprehensive test suite covering requirements
   - Use project-specific test framework and patterns
   - Ensure tests fail initially (red phase)

3. **Test Commit**:
   - Commit failing tests with descriptive message
   - Establish baseline for implementation

#### **Phase 2: Implementation Iteration**
1. **Minimal Implementation**:
   - Write minimal code to pass first test
   - Avoid over-engineering or premature optimization
   - Focus on making tests green incrementally

2. **Test-Code Cycle**:
   - Run tests after each code change
   - Iterate until all tests pass
   - Maintain test integrity (no test modifications)

3. **Verification with Subagents**:
   - Deploy subagents to verify implementation quality
   - Check for overfitting to tests
   - Validate against independent criteria

#### **Phase 3: Refactor & Commit**
1. **Code Quality Enhancement**:
   - Refactor while maintaining test passing state
   - Apply project coding standards
   - Optimize performance where appropriate

2. **Final Validation**:
   - Run full test suite
   - Validate integration with existing code
   - Ensure no regressions

3. **Implementation Commit**:
   - Commit clean implementation
   - Generate comprehensive commit message
   - Link to requirements and test coverage

### **TDD-Specific Features**
- **Test Framework Detection**: Auto-detect project test setup
- **Coverage Analysis**: Report test coverage metrics
- **Failure Analysis**: Intelligent test failure debugging
- **Refactoring Safety**: Ensure tests pass during refactoring
