# Jest Removal Cleanup - July 2, 2025

## Problem Statement
Jest tests were still running automatically in VS Code despite the project's migration to Playwright-only testing strategy. The user was experiencing:
- Automatic Jest terminal opening in VS Code
- Jest-specific errors appearing in VS Code Problems console
- Background Jest processes consuming resources
- Confusion about testing approach (Jest vs Playwright)

## Root Cause Analysis
The project had remnants of Jest configuration and dependencies even after the intended migration to Playwright-only testing:

### Active Jest Components Found:
1. **Running Processes**: 4 active Jest processes in watch mode
   - Process 1114: Shell wrapper for npm test
   - Process 1115: npm test command
   - Process 1151: Jest shell execution
   - Process 1152: Main Jest node process (consuming 478MB RAM)

2. **Configuration Files**:
   - `jest.config.backup.js` - Backup Jest configuration
   - `jest.config.old.js` - Legacy Jest configuration

3. **Package.json Scripts**:
   - `"test": "jest"`
   - `"test:watch": "jest --watch"`
   - `"test:coverage": "jest --coverage"`

4. **Jest Dependencies** (9 total):
   - `@testing-library/jest-dom`
   - `@testing-library/react`
   - `@testing-library/user-event`
   - `@types/jest`
   - `@types/jest-axe`
   - `@types/testing-library__jest-dom`
   - `jest`
   - `jest-axe`
   - `jest-environment-jsdom`

5. **Type Definitions**:
   - `src/types/jest.d.ts` - Jest type extensions

## Solution Implementation

### Phase 1: Stop Active Processes
```bash
# Identified running Jest processes
ps aux | grep -i jest

# Terminated all Jest processes
kill -TERM 1114 1115 1151 1152

# Verified processes stopped
ps aux | grep -i jest | grep -v grep  # No output = success
```

### Phase 2: Remove Configuration Files
```bash
# Removed backup Jest config files
rm /home/user/tylergohr.com/jest.config.backup.js
rm /home/user/tylergohr.com/jest.config.old.js

# Removed Jest type definitions
rm /home/user/tylergohr.com/src/types/jest.d.ts
```

### Phase 3: Clean Package.json
Removed Jest scripts and dependencies from package.json:

**Scripts Removed**:
```json
"test": "jest",
"test:watch": "jest --watch", 
"test:coverage": "jest --coverage",
```

**Dependencies Removed**:
```json
"@testing-library/jest-dom": "^6.6.3",
"@testing-library/react": "^16.3.0",
"@testing-library/user-event": "^14.6.1",
"@types/jest": "^30.0.0",
"@types/jest-axe": "^3.5.9",
"@types/testing-library__jest-dom": "^5.14.9",
"jest": "^30.0.2",
"jest-axe": "^10.0.0",
"jest-environment-jsdom": "^30.0.2",
```

### Phase 4: Validation
```bash
# Verified no Jest references remain
grep -r "jest" package.json .vscode/ 2>/dev/null || echo "No Jest references found"

# Confirmed project still builds and validates
npm run validate
# ✅ typecheck passed
# ✅ lint passed  
# ✅ build passed
```

## Results

### Before Cleanup:
- 4 active Jest processes consuming ~478MB RAM
- Jest watch mode running continuously
- VS Code showing Jest errors
- Conflicting testing strategies (Jest + Playwright)

### After Cleanup:
- ✅ Zero Jest processes running
- ✅ Clean package.json with Playwright-only dependencies
- ✅ No Jest configuration files
- ✅ Project builds and validates successfully
- ✅ Clear Playwright-only testing strategy

## Current Testing Architecture

The project now has a clean Playwright-only testing setup as documented in CLAUDE.md:

### Fast Development Testing:
```bash
npm run test:e2e:smoke         # Ultra-fast validation (<1min)
npm run test:e2e:dev           # Functional testing (2-3min)
npm run test:e2e:component     # Component-focused testing
```

### Comprehensive Testing:
```bash
npm run test:e2e:portfolio     # Full /2 redesign validation
npm run test:e2e:visual        # Visual regression testing
npm run test:e2e:accessibility # A11y compliance testing
```

### Visual Review with Claude:
```bash
npx playwright test e2e/quick-screenshots.spec.ts --project=chromium
npm run test:e2e:claude-review
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **VS Code Extensions**: The Jest extension was auto-running tests even without explicit configuration
2. **Backup Files**: Old configuration files can interfere with intended architecture
3. **Complete Cleanup**: Need to remove scripts, dependencies, types, and processes
4. **Process Management**: Background processes can persist beyond configuration changes

## Prevention Strategies

1. **VS Code Settings**: Consider disabling/uninstalling Jest extension
2. **Clean Migration**: Use systematic approach to remove all traces of deprecated tools
3. **Documentation**: CLAUDE.md clearly documents Playwright-only strategy
4. **Process Monitoring**: Regular check for unwanted background processes

## File Changes Summary

### Files Removed:
- `jest.config.backup.js`
- `jest.config.old.js` 
- `src/types/jest.d.ts`

### Files Modified:
- `package.json` - Removed Jest scripts and 9 dependencies

### Files Preserved:
