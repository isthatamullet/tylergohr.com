# Claude Code Scratchpad Integration Guide

A comprehensive guide for effectively using scratchpads with Claude Code to enhance development workflows and knowledge capture.

## 🎯 Why Scratchpads with Claude Code?

Claude Code sessions are powerful but stateless - each conversation starts fresh. Scratchpads bridge this gap by providing:

- **Context Persistence**: Maintain investigation findings across sessions
- **Knowledge Accumulation**: Build a searchable repository of solutions and patterns  
- **Efficient Problem-Solving**: Reference previous work to avoid repeating investigations
- **Collaborative Documentation**: Share insights and approaches with team members

## 🚀 Quick Start Workflow

### 1. Starting a New Claude Session
```markdown
1. Check existing scratchpads for related work:
   - Browse docs/scratchpad/investigations/ for similar issues
   - Review docs/scratchpad/experiments/ for relevant technical patterns
   
2. Create new scratchpad if needed:
   - Copy appropriate template from docs/scratchpad/templates/
   - Use VS Code snippets: `scratchpad-investigation`, `scratchpad-feature`, etc.
   
3. Reference context in Claude:
   "I'm working on [issue]. I have a scratchpad at docs/scratchpad/investigations/hero-positioning-2025-06-29.md with previous findings."
```

### 2. During Development
```markdown
1. Document real-time discoveries:
   - Use timeline entries with timestamps
   - Record both successful and failed approaches
   - Include code snippets and test results

2. Update scratchpad as you work:
   - Add Claude's suggestions and reasoning
   - Document decision points and trade-offs
   - Track performance impacts and measurements

3. Maintain context for Claude:
   - Reference scratchpad findings in conversation
   - Copy relevant snippets to maintain context
   - Ask Claude to help analyze patterns across experiments
```

### 3. Session Completion
```markdown
1. Finalize scratchpad documentation:
   - Summarize key findings and final solution
   - Document lessons learned for future reference
   - Add links to related files and resources

2. Create follow-up actions:
   - Convert findings to GitHub issues if needed
   - Update project documentation
   - Plan related experiments or improvements

3. Archive or organize:
   - Move completed investigations to archive folder
   - Update README with key learnings
   - Create quick reference guides for common patterns
```

## 💡 Effective Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Investigation Continuity
When returning to a complex issue across multiple Claude sessions:

```markdown
Session 1: Initial Investigation
→ Create scratchpad with problem statement and initial findings
→ Document approaches tried and their results
→ End with clear "next steps" section

Session 2: Deep Dive  
→ Reference previous scratchpad in Claude conversation
→ Continue investigation from where you left off
→ Add new findings to existing timeline
→ Build on previous context rather than starting over

Session 3: Solution Implementation
→ Use scratchpad to guide Claude's implementation approach
→ Document final solution and validation results
→ Create implementation notes for future reference
```

### Pattern 2: Experiment Documentation
For trying new technical approaches:

```markdown
Pre-Experiment: Hypothesis Formation
→ Create experiment scratchpad with clear hypothesis
→ Define success criteria and measurement approach
→ Document baseline state and expected outcomes

During Experiment: Real-time Documentation
→ Record each iteration attempt with Claude
→ Document both successes and failures
→ Include performance measurements and visual comparisons

Post-Experiment: Knowledge Capture
→ Analyze results with Claude's help
→ Extract reusable patterns and principles
→ Create recommendations for future work
```

### Pattern 3: Feature Planning
For comprehensive feature development:

```markdown
Planning Phase: Requirements and Architecture
→ Use feature planning template to structure thinking
→ Collaborate with Claude on technical architecture decisions
→ Document constraints, risks, and design considerations

Implementation Phase: Progress Tracking
→ Reference planning scratchpad during development
→ Update implementation notes as work progresses
→ Document deviations from original plan and rationale

Review Phase: Lessons and Improvements
→ Analyze actual vs. planned outcomes
→ Identify patterns for future feature development
→ Create reusable templates for similar features
```

## 🔧 Technical Integration

### VS Code Setup
```json
// Recommended settings for scratchpad workflow
{
  "files.associations": {
    "**/scratchpad/**/*.md": "markdown"
  },
  "search.exclude": {
    "**/scratchpad/archived": true
  },
  "explorer.fileNesting.enabled": true
}
```

### Claude Code Context Sharing
```markdown
Effective ways to share scratchpad context with Claude:

1. Paste key sections directly:
   "Here's what I discovered in my previous investigation: [paste timeline]"

2. Reference specific findings:
   "My scratchpad shows that approach X failed because of Y. Can you suggest alternatives?"

3. Share measurement data:
   "Previous experiments showed these performance results: [paste metrics]"

4. Build on documented patterns:
   "I have a pattern documented for similar issues: [describe pattern]"
```

### Git Integration
```bash
# Scratchpads are gitignored by default for privacy
# To share specific insights, create documentation:

# Convert scratchpad findings to formal documentation
cp docs/scratchpad/investigations/useful-pattern.md docs/PATTERN-GUIDE.md

# Or reference in commit messages
git commit -m "Fix hero positioning

Based on investigation in scratchpad docs/scratchpad/investigations/hero-positioning-2025-06-29.md:
- Root cause: flexbox centering with variable content height
- Solution: flex-start + padding-top offset
- Validated with Puppeteer testing"
```

## 📊 Best Practices

### 1. Naming Conventions
```
investigations/
├── hero-positioning-2025-06-29.md
├── performance-regression-2025-06-30.md
└── mobile-navigation-issue-2025-07-01.md

experiments/
├── css-grid-layout-alternatives.md
├── animation-performance-optimization.md
└── responsive-typography-scaling.md

planning/
├── blog-system-architecture.md
├── search-functionality-design.md
└── analytics-integration-strategy.md
```

### 2. Context Management
```markdown
## Effective Context Sharing with Claude

✅ Good:
"I'm continuing work on the hero positioning issue. My scratchpad shows the root cause is flexbox centering with variable content height. Previous attempts with padding adjustments got close but need fine-tuning."

❌ Not Helpful:
"Look at my scratchpad file and tell me what to do next."

✅ Good:
"Here are the performance metrics from my experiment scratchpad:
- Baseline: 94ms load time
- Attempt 1: 87ms (improvement)
- Attempt 2: 102ms (regression)
Can you help analyze why attempt 2 performed worse?"

❌ Not Helpful:
"My experiment file has the results."
```

### 3. Knowledge Building
```markdown
Create patterns and reusable insights:

## Common Patterns
- Flexbox centering issues with variable content
- CSS performance optimization approaches  
- Mobile responsive debugging techniques
- Cross-browser compatibility testing methods

## Quick Reference Guides
- Performance testing checklist
- Common CSS gotchas and solutions
- Debugging techniques for different issue types
- Tools and commands that are frequently useful
```

### 4. Session Efficiency
```markdown
Start each Claude session with:
1. Brief context of what you're working on
2. Reference to relevant scratchpad(s)
3. Specific question or goal for the session
4. Any constraints or preferences

Example:
"I'm optimizing the hero section positioning (scratchpad: hero-positioning-2025-06-29.md). 
Previous attempts got within 2px of target. Current approach uses flex-start + padding-top. 
Goal: Achieve exact positioning match across all three pages. 
Constraint: Must maintain responsive behavior."
```

## 🔍 Advanced Techniques

### Cross-Reference System
```markdown
Create connections between related scratchpads:

In hero-positioning-2025-06-29.md:
## Related Work
- See: css-flexbox-experiments.md for alternative centering approaches

```

### Pattern Recognition
```markdown
Build reusable problem-solving patterns:

## Pattern: CSS Positioning Inconsistency
1. Measure actual positions with Puppeteer/browser tools
2. Identify differences in computed styles
3. Check for content-dependent layout (flexbox, grid)
4. Test solution with various content lengths
5. Validate across breakpoints and browsers

Applied in:
- hero-positioning-2025-06-29.md ✅
- card-alignment-2025-06-15.md ✅  
- footer-spacing-2025-05-20.md ✅
