## Monitoring and Management

### Monitoring Tools

#### Preview Status Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor active preview deployments
./scripts/monitor-preview.sh

# Check resource usage and costs
./scripts/cost-monitor.sh
```

#### Manual Monitoring
```bash
# List all preview services
gcloud run services list --region=us-central1 --filter="metadata.name:portfolio-pr-*"

# Check specific service status  
gcloud run services describe portfolio-pr-9-feature-name --region=us-central1

# View service logs
gcloud run services logs read portfolio-pr-9-feature-name --region=us-central1
```

### Resource Management

#### Automatic Cleanup

The system automatically cleans up resources when:
- PR is merged to main branch
- PR is closed without merging  
- PR is converted from draft (optional)

Cleanup includes:
- Cloud Run service deletion
- Container image removal
- Resource deallocation
- Cost elimination

#### Manual Cleanup (Emergency)

```bash
# Delete all preview services
gcloud run services list --region=us-central1 \
  --filter="metadata.name:portfolio-pr-*" \
  --format="value(metadata.name)" | \
  xargs -I {} gcloud run services delete {} --region=us-central1 --quiet

# Clean up old container images
gcloud container images list --repository="gcr.io/tylergohr-portfolio" \
  --format="value(name)" | while read image; do
    gcloud container images list-tags "$image" \
      --format="get(digest)" --sort-by="~timestamp" \
      --limit=100 | tail -n +6 | while read digest; do
        gcloud container images delete "$image@$digest" \
          --quiet --force-delete-tags
    done
  done
```

## Configuration

### Workflow Configuration

The preview deployment system is configured in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
# Preview deployment job
preview-deployment:
  name: 'Deploy Preview Environment'
  needs: [quality-gates]
  if: github.event.action != 'closed' && needs.quality-gates.result == 'success'
```

### Resource Allocation

Preview environments use optimized resource allocation:

```yaml
# Cloud Run configuration for previews
--memory=512Mi        # 512MB RAM (vs 2GB production)
--cpu=1              # 1 vCPU (vs 1 vCPU production)  
--concurrency=10     # 10 requests/instance (vs 100 production)
--max-instances=2    # Max 2 instances (vs 10 production)
--timeout=300        # 5 minutes timeout
```

### Environment Variables

Preview services inherit production configuration:

```yaml
NODE_ENV=production
NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Preview Deployment Fails

**Symptoms**: GitHub Actions workflow fails during preview deployment
**Causes**: Resource limits, image build failures, Cloud Run quota issues

2. Check health endpoint: `{preview-url}/api/health`
3. Review Cloud Run service logs
4. Verify service status in Google Cloud Console

#### High Resource Usage

**Symptoms**: Unexpected Cloud Run charges, many preview services
**Causes**: PRs not being cleaned up, orphaned services, resource leaks
**Solutions**:
1. Run cost monitoring: `./scripts/cost-monitor.sh`
2. Clean up old services manually
3. Check for failed cleanup workflows
4. Review PR closure processes

#### Cleanup Not Working

**Symptoms**: Preview services remain after PR close/merge
**Causes**: Workflow failures, permission issues, concurrent operations
**Solutions**:
1. Check cleanup workflow logs
2. Manually delete services: `./scripts/cost-monitor.sh`
3. Verify GitHub Actions permissions
4. Re-run cleanup workflow if needed

### Debugging Steps

1. **Check Workflow Status**: Review GitHub Actions logs
2. **Verify Service Status**: Check Cloud Run console
3. **Test Health Endpoint**: Verify application is responding
4. **Review Resource Usage**: Monitor costs and allocation
5. **Check Cleanup Status**: Ensure automatic cleanup is working

## Cost Management

### Cost Structure

Preview deployments use Google Cloud Run's pay-per-use model:

- **CPU**: Charged per vCPU-second while handling requests
- **Memory**: Charged per GB-second while handling requests  
- **Requests**: Charged per million requests
- **Idle Time**: Minimal charges when scaled to 0

### Estimated Costs

With default preview configuration:
- **Per Preview Service**: ~$0.01-0.10 per day (typical usage)
- **Per PR Lifecycle**: ~$0.05-0.50 total (creation to cleanup)
- **Monthly Budget**: $5-20 for active development (5-10 concurrent PRs)

### Cost Optimization Features

- **Auto-scaling to 0**: Services stop consuming resources when idle
- **Optimized Resources**: Reduced CPU/memory vs production
- **Automatic Cleanup**: No ongoing costs after PR closure
- **Monitoring Tools**: Built-in cost tracking and alerts

### Budget Alerts

Set up Google Cloud budget alerts:
1. Google Cloud Console ‚Üí Billing ‚Üí Budgets & alerts
2. Create budget for Cloud Run services
3. Set threshold alerts at $10, $25, $50
4. Configure email notifications

## Security

### Access Control

- **Public Access**: Preview services allow unauthenticated access for easy sharing
- **Temporary URLs**: Services are deleted after PR closure
- **No Sensitive Data**: Preview environments should not contain production data
- **Isolated Resources**: Each preview runs in isolated container

### Best Practices

- **Environment Variables**: Never include secrets in preview environments
- **Data Isolation**: Use test/mock data only
- **Access Logging**: Monitor who accesses preview URLs
- **Time Limits**: Close PRs promptly to remove access
