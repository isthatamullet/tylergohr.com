# System Overview
cat << 'EOF'
üìã SYSTEM OVERVIEW
------------------

This port management system provides:
‚úÖ Intelligent port discovery and health assessment
‚úÖ Automatic cleanup of unhealthy servers
‚úÖ Smart selection of optimal development ports
‚úÖ Cloud environment compatibility
‚úÖ Integration with Claude Code hooks system
‚úÖ Comprehensive testing and monitoring

üéØ PROBLEM SOLVED
-----------------
- Eliminates multi-server timeout conflicts
- Prevents resource waste from hung processes

echo "-------------------------------------------"

cat << 'EOF'
Based on testing, consider these optimizations:

1. REDUCE SCAN RANGE (if needed):
   - Edit PORT_RANGE_START/END in port-manager.sh
   - Default 3000-4010 covers typical development use

2. OPTIMIZE HEALTH CHECK TIMEOUT:
   - Current: 10 seconds (good for cloud environments)
   - Local development: Could reduce to 5 seconds
   - Slow networks: Increase to 15 seconds

3. ENABLE FAST MODE FOR DAILY USE:
   - Use 'assess' instead of 'full-cycle' for quick checks
   - Run 'full-cycle' only when issues detected

4. CACHE OPTIMIZATION:
   - Port cache TTL: 30 minutes (adjust based on usage)
   - Clear cache if servers change frequently

echo "üîó HOOKS SYSTEM INTEGRATION"
echo "----------------------------"

cat << 'EOF'
To integrate with existing Claude Code hooks:

1. AUTOMATIC INTEGRATION:
   - Port detection utilities already integrated
   - Hooks will automatically use optimal ports

2. MANUAL INTEGRATION:
   - Add to pre-tool hooks: ./scripts/hooks/integration/port-management-integration.sh pre-tool
   - Add to post-tool hooks: ./scripts/hooks/integration/port-management-integration.sh post-tool

3. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
   - ACTIVE_DEV_PORT: Currently selected port
   - ACTIVE_DEV_URL: Cloud-aware URL for the port

echo "üìà MONITORING AND MAINTENANCE"
echo "------------------------------"

cat << 'EOF'
Regular maintenance tasks:

DAILY:
- ./scripts/port-manager.sh assess (quick health check)

WEEKLY:
- ./scripts/port-manager.sh full-cycle (comprehensive cleanup)
- ./scripts/test-port-scenarios.sh single (basic test)

MONTHLY:
- ./scripts/test-port-scenarios.sh all (comprehensive test)
- Review logs in ~/.claude/hooks/port-management-integration.log

AS NEEDED:
- ./scripts/port-manager.sh cleanup (when servers hang)
- ./scripts/port-manager.sh consolidate (when multiple servers running)

echo "üö® TROUBLESHOOTING QUICK REFERENCE"
echo "-----------------------------------"

cat << 'EOF'
Common issues and solutions:

ISSUE: No servers discovered
SOLUTION: Check if dev server is running: npm run dev

ISSUE: Timeouts during health checks
SOLUTION: Increase timeout: HEALTH_CHECK_TIMEOUT=15 ./scripts/port-manager.sh assess

ISSUE: Permission denied errors
SOLUTION: Check user permissions for kill/fuser commands

ISSUE: Port manager hangs
SOLUTION: Remove lock file: rm -f /tmp/port-manager.lock

ISSUE: Multiple servers won't consolidate
SOLUTION: Force cleanup: ./scripts/port-manager.sh cleanup

ISSUE: Cloud URLs not working
SOLUTION: Test detection: ./scripts/detect-active-port.sh

cat << 'EOF'
1. IMMEDIATE (Today):
   - Test the full-cycle command in your development workflow
   - Verify cloud URL detection works with your environment
   - Run basic health checks to establish baseline

2. THIS WEEK:
   - Integrate with your daily development routine
   - Test during typical development tasks (editing, testing, building)
   - Monitor performance and adjust timeouts if needed

3. ONGOING:
   - Monitor logs for any recurring issues
   - Optimize configuration based on your usage patterns
   - Consider automation through npm scripts or aliases
