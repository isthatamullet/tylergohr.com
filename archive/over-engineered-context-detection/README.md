# Context Detection Over-Engineering Archive

## ⚠️ DO NOT USE - 513 Lines to Detect Development Context

This directory contains **2 scripts totaling 513 lines** that were created to solve the simple problem of "know if we're working on main portfolio or /2 redesign."

### The Simple Solution We Should Have Used:
```bash
# Check current context
pwd | grep -q "/2" && echo "redesign" || echo "main"
```

### What We Actually Built Instead:

#### **context-detection.sh (375 lines)**
*Intelligent change impact assessment and development context detection*

#### **development-context-optimizer.sh (138 lines)**
*Context-aware development optimization*

### The Ridiculous Features:
- **Intelligent Context Analysis** - AI-powered context detection
- **Development Workflow Optimization** - Context-specific optimizations
- **Change Impact Assessment** - Determining impact based on context
- **Context-Aware Operation Selection** - Different operations per context
- **Workflow State Management** - Managing context-specific states
- **Context Persistence** - Saving context across sessions

### What It Actually Does:
Detects if you're working on main portfolio vs /2 redesign... something a simple `pwd` check could handle.

### Lessons Learned:
1. **Context detection doesn't need 375 lines of code**
2. **A simple path check > complex context analysis**
3. **Workflow optimization for 2 contexts = over-engineering**
4. **Sometimes `pwd | grep` is the right solution**

### What To Do Instead:
```bash
# Check if working on /2 redesign
if [[ $(pwd) =~ /2 ]]; then
    echo "Working on Enterprise Solutions Architect redesign"
else
    echo "Working on main portfolio"
fi
```
