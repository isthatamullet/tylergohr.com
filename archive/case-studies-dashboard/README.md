### Technical Implementation

## Reason for Archival
The dashboard component was removed from the Case Studies page to:

1. **Improve Performance**
   - Reduce page load time by removing heavy charts and animations
   - Decrease bundle size (removed Recharts and complex animations)
   - Simplify component tree and reduce rendering complexity

2. **Enhance User Experience**
   - Focus user attention on core case studies content
   - Eliminate potential distraction from main portfolio content
   - Provide cleaner, more focused page presentation

3. **Simplify Maintenance**
   - Remove complex dashboard state management
   - Reduce CSS complexity and responsive breakpoints
   - Eliminate dependencies on Recharts library

4. **Strategic Focus**
   - Align with portfolio's core value proposition
   - Emphasize case studies over abstract metrics
   - Prioritize authentic project showcases

## Dependencies
The component requires these dependencies to function:
```json
{
  "react": "^18.0.0",
  "framer-motion": "^10.0.0",
  "recharts": "^2.5.0"
}
```

## Original Integration
The component was previously integrated into the Case Studies page as:

```typescript
// Lazy import (line 13)
const RealTimeMetricsDashboard = lazy(() => import('@/app/2/components/BusinessMetrics/RealTimeMetricsDashboard'))

// Integration (lines 249-260)
<Section background="hero" paddingY="xl">
  <div 
    ref={(el) => { sectionRefs.current['metrics'] = el }}
    data-section-id="metrics"
    className={`${styles.metricsSection} ${visibleSections.has('metrics') ? styles.revealed : ''}`}
  >
    <Suspense fallback={<div className={styles.loadingPlaceholder}>Loading business metrics...</div>}>
      <RealTimeMetricsDashboard className={styles.businessMetrics} />
    </Suspense>
  </div>
</Section>
```
