## ⚠️ DO NOT USE - 1,728 Lines for Taking Screenshots

This directory contains **4 scripts totaling 1,728 lines** that were created to solve the simple problem of "take screenshots when files change."

### The Simple Solution We Should Have Used:
```bash
npx playwright test e2e/quick-screenshots.spec.ts --project=chromium
```

### What We Actually Built Instead:

#### **browser-pool-coordinator.sh (517 lines)**
*Coordinating browsers... to take screenshots*

#### **puppeteer-screenshot-service.sh (459 lines)**  
*Service for managing screenshot generation with Puppeteer*

#### **screenshot-strategy-selector.sh (424 lines)**
*"Intelligent" selection between screenshot strategies*

#### **visual-change-detection.sh (328 lines)**
*Detecting visual changes to determine screenshot needs*

### The Ridiculous Features:
- **Browser Pool Coordination** - Managing browser resources for screenshots
- **Screenshot Strategy Intelligence** - AI-powered strategy selection
- **Visual Change Detection** - 6 different types of visual changes
- **Hybrid Validation Strategy** - Multiple screenshot approaches
- **Performance Impact Analysis** - Analyzing performance of screenshots
- **Context-Aware Processing** - Screenshot context awareness

### Lessons Learned:
1. **Screenshots don't need strategy selection**
2. **One Playwright command > 1,728 lines of coordination**
3. **Browser pools for screenshots = massive over-engineering**
4. **Visual change detection for simple screenshots = complexity hell**

### What To Do Instead:
```bash
# For quick review screenshots
npx playwright test e2e/quick-screenshots.spec.ts --project=chromium

# That's literally it.
```
