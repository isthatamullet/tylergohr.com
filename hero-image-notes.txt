/explore-plan-commit great! while i finish up the hamburger stuff, i want to explore and investigate the most simple and efficient way to replace the homepage hero image with a new image i have created in canva and saved as 4 different svg files. one is the 'main' image, and the other 3 are clouds. all 4 svg files have been exported with transparent backgrounds. the 3 cloud svg files should contain vertical / horizontal positioning so that they can appear on top of the main image with a sort of floating effect.
