# Tyler Gohr Portfolio - Security Architecture

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security architecture implemented for the Tyler Gohr portfolio website, demonstrating modern security practices and multi-layered protection strategies.

## üéØ Security Philosophy

Our security approach follows the principle of **defense in depth** with multiple security layers:
- **Shift-left security**: Vulnerabilities caught early in development
- **Automated scanning**: Continuous monitoring for security issues
- **Zero-trust architecture**: Every component validated and secured
- **Cost-effective protection**: Enterprise-grade security without enterprise costs

## üîç Security Architecture Layers

### 1. Source Code Security (GitHub Advanced Security)

**Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**
- **CodeQL Analysis**: Enhanced JavaScript/TypeScript security scanning
- **Security Query Suites**: 
  - `security-extended` for comprehensive vulnerability detection
  - `security-experimental` for cutting-edge threat detection
- **Automated Scheduling**: Weekly security scans (Mondays 2AM UTC)
- **Pull Request Integration**: Real-time security feedback on code changes

**Secret Protection**
- **Secret Scanning**: Automatic detection of API keys, tokens, passwords
- **Push Protection**: Blocks commits containing secrets before they reach the repository
- **Pattern Recognition**: Detects both structured credentials and unstructured passwords

**Dependency Security**
- **Dependabot**: Automated vulnerability scanning for npm packages
- **Security Updates**: Automatic pull requests for vulnerable dependencies
- **Dependency Review**: Security analysis on dependency changes

### 2. Container Security (Trivy Integration)

**Container Vulnerability Scanning**
- **Trivy Scanner**: Free, comprehensive container vulnerability detection
- **Multi-layer Analysis**: OS packages, application dependencies, and misconfigurations
- **Severity Classification**: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM vulnerability categorization
- **SARIF Integration**: Results uploaded to GitHub Security tab for unified reporting

**Scan Coverage**
- **Operating System Packages**: Ubuntu/Alpine Linux package vulnerabilities
- **Language Packages**: Node.js dependency vulnerabilities in container context
- **Configuration Issues**: Container security misconfigurations

**Integration Points**
- **PR Preview Environments**: Every preview deployment scanned automatically
- **Non-blocking Analysis**: Security scanning doesn't halt development velocity
- **Report Artifacts**: 30-day retention of detailed security reports

### 3. Infrastructure Security (Google Cloud Run)

**Platform-Level Protection**
- **Managed Container Runtime**: Google-managed security updates and patches
- **Network Isolation**: Automatic VPC isolation for container instances
- **IAM Integration**: Least-privilege access controls
- **Automatic SSL/TLS**: Managed certificates and encryption in transit

**Resource Controls**
- **Resource Limits**: Memory and CPU constraints prevent resource exhaustion
- **Concurrency Limits**: Request limiting to prevent abuse
- **Auto-scaling**: Automatic scaling with security-first configuration

### 4. Application Security (Next.js)

**Security Headers**
```typescript
// Implemented security headers
{
  'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff',
  'X-Frame-Options': 'DENY',
  'Referrer-Policy': 'origin-when-cross-origin',
  'Content-Security-Policy': "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'"
}
```

**Input Validation & Sanitization**
- **Contact Form Protection**: Rate limiting and input sanitization
- **XSS Prevention**: Output encoding and CSP implementation
- **CSRF Protection**: Built-in Next.js CSRF protections

**Performance Security**
- **Bundle Size Monitoring**: 1.2MB budget prevents bloated dependencies
- **Core Web Vitals**: Performance monitoring prevents certain attack vectors

## üìä Security Monitoring & Reporting

### GitHub Security Dashboard
- **Unified View**: All security findings in GitHub Security tab
- **SARIF Integration**: Standardized security report format
- **Historical Tracking**: Vulnerability trend analysis
- **Alert Management**: Automated notifications for critical findings

### Automated Security Workflows

**Pull Request Security Checks**
1. CodeQL static analysis on code changes
2. Dependabot dependency review
3. Container security scanning on preview builds
4. Security summary in PR comments

**Scheduled Security Maintenance**
- **Weekly CodeQL Scans**: Comprehensive security analysis
- **Dependency Updates**: Automated security patch applications
- **Security Report Generation**: Regular security posture assessments

## üéØ Risk Assessment & Threat Model

### Attack Surface Analysis

**Minimal Attack Surface**
- **Static Content**: Primarily static Next.js site reduces attack vectors
- **Single Form Endpoint**: Only contact form accepts user input
- **No User Authentication**: No user accounts or session management
- **No Database**: No persistent data storage reducing data breach risk

**Primary Threat Vectors**
1. **Supply Chain Attacks**: Malicious npm packages or dependencies
2. **Container Vulnerabilities**: OS or runtime vulnerabilities in container
3. **Input Validation**: Contact form injection attacks
4. **Infrastructure**: Cloud platform security misconfigurations

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

**Supply Chain Security**
- ‚úÖ **Dependabot Monitoring**: Continuous dependency vulnerability tracking
- ‚úÖ **Package Integrity**: npm audit and vulnerability scanning
- ‚úÖ **Dependency Review**: Security analysis on all dependency changes

**Container Security**
- ‚úÖ **Multi-layer Scanning**: OS and application vulnerability detection
- ‚úÖ **Base Image Security**: Regular Node.js official image updates
- ‚úÖ **Runtime Monitoring**: Continuous security scanning of deployed containers

**Application Security**
- ‚úÖ **Input Sanitization**: Contact form protection and validation
- ‚úÖ **Security Headers**: XSS, clickjacking, and content type protections
- ‚úÖ **CSP Implementation**: Content Security Policy preventing injection attacks

**Infrastructure Security**
- ‚úÖ **Managed Platform**: Google Cloud Run handles infrastructure security
- ‚úÖ **Network Isolation**: VPC and firewall protections
- ‚úÖ **Access Controls**: IAM-based least-privilege access
