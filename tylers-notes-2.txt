I asked claude code to take a screenshot of a section of my tylergohr.com/2 site. it began running playwright tests which took a while, so i stopped claude and asked "> sorry to stop you, but i want to know about my new mcp server capabilities! doesn't it include a screenshot tool?" 

Perfect! I can see the system is set up well - the Puppeteer service automatically falls back to Playwright when
  Puppeteer fails, which is excellent design.

  Key findings:
  1. Your MCP server is working well - it's providing intelligent testing strategy recommendations
  2. Puppeteer installation issue: The hooks directory is looking for Puppeteer in the wrong location
  3. Automatic fallback works: When Puppeteer fails, it falls back to Playwright
  4. Same scroll/animation issue: All screenshots still show black screens due to scroll-triggered content
