# Tyler Gohr - Career Story Script (Beats Version)

## Overview
Interactive click/tap-to-advance presentation using accumulated text "beats."

**Format:** Reveal.js with fragments (text accumulates within each beat)
**Navigation:** Click/tap advances to next beat; text builds within beats
**Visual style:** Handwritten text effect, AI-generated imagery
**Target runtime:** ~2-2.5 minutes
**Target clicks:** ~25-30 total

---

## How Beats Work

```
[auto] Line appears automatically (1-2 second delay)
[CLICK] User clicks/taps to advance to next beat
```

Text accumulates on screen within each beat, giving users time to catch up before clicking.

---

## UX Principle

**All text accumulates and stays visible until next click.** Users control pace. Designed for partial-attention viewing (mobile, multitasking).

In 2026, 2-3 minutes = infinite. Users will glance away, check notifications, come back. Accumulated text means they never lose their place. Click points act as natural "checkpoints" - catch up, confirm ready, continue.

---

## Technical Notes for Reveal.js

### Configuration
```javascript
Reveal.configure({
  autoSlide: 150, // 150ms per word fragment (speaking pace)
  autoSlideStoppable: true,
  fragments: true,
  fragmentInURL: true // preserves state on back/forward
});
```

### Word-by-Word Animation (Native Fragments)
Use Reveal.js native fragments for smooth back/forth navigation. No external libraries needed.

```html
<!-- Example: One beat with word-by-word reveal -->
<section>
  <span class="fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="1">It's</span>
  <span class="fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="2">2008.</span>
  <span class="fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="3">I'm</span>
  <span class="fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="4">staring</span>
  <span class="fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="5">at</span>
  <span class="fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="6">47</span>
  <span class="fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="7">browser</span>
  <span class="fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="8">tabs.</span>
</section>
```

### Why Native Fragments (Not Typed.js or GSAP)
- **Smooth back/forth navigation** - Reveal.js optimized for this
- **No jitter on slide revisit** - fragments show/hide cleanly
- **No external dependencies** - reduces failure points
- **Mobile-tested** - tap navigation works perfectly

### CSS Transition for Smooth Feel
```css
.fragment.fade-in {
  opacity: 0;
  transition: opacity 0.15s ease-in;
}
.fragment.fade-in.visible {
  opacity: 1;
}
```

### Beat Structure
- Each beat = one `<section>` slide
- Words within beat = individual fragments with auto-advance
- End of beat = pause for user click/tap to next slide
- `autoSlide: 0` on final fragment of each beat to wait for click

---

## Visual Production Notes

**Animations:**
- Phone ringing (Beats 8, 18, 25)
- Email popup (Beat 13)
- Disney visual cue (Beat 32) - dollar signs, acquisition graphic
- Language list scroll effect (Beat 22)
- Emmy trophy (Beat 36)

**Text styling:**

## EXTERNAL REVIEW FEEDBACK (January 25, 2026)

### What's Working ✅
- Emmy = showstopper, undeniable proof in 10 words
- Numbers are concrete ($1.5M, 68%→96%, 1B minutes)
- "iTunes Whisperer" = memorable branding
- "Most people are watching. I'm building." = money line (but it's buried!)
- Philosophy ending lands authentically

### What Needs Work ⚠️

**SDI section drags** - Ready for Fox by beat 23. Consider trimming.

**Beat 22 (language list) too long** - Audience gets it by line 3. (Note: our escalating effect idea may fix this - make it intentionally overwhelming)

**Fox Nation/Weather = laundry list** - Too much "and then I did this." (Our rewrite already addresses this somewhat)

**AI section is vague** - "Serving traffic" means nothing. What problem does it solve? Who uses it?

**Missing elements:**
- Team size ("managed X direct reports", "coordinated 30+ vendors")
- Budget ownership (did you OWN a budget?)
- One failure story (everything working is suspicious)
- Explicit CTA at end (what are you looking for?)
- Tech stack keywords (Python? Node? AWS? Azure?)

**Peter Jackson story** - Reads as heroics, not systems. Was there a systemic fix after?

### Personas Summary (Claude)
| Persona | Verdict |
|---------|---------|
| Hiring Manager | Wants team size, budget, CTA |
| Impatient Exec | Skip beats 3-4, language list, Fox laundry list |
| Technical Leader | Wants architecture tradeoffs, failure stories |
| Recruiter | Needs tech stack, level language, availability keyword |

---

## GEMINI REVIEW FEEDBACK (January 25, 2026)

### Verdicts by Persona
| Persona | Verdict |
|---------|---------|
| Hiring Manager | "Yes, I'd interview him" ✅ |
| Impatient Exec | "Stop at Beat 20, but forward to VP" |
| Technical Leader | "Skeptical - can he actually code?" ⚠️ |
| Recruiter | "Hard to categorize - PM? Ops? Dev?" |

### Unique Gemini Insights

**"Sorcery" is a RED FLAG** - Beat 15 "Then I began my sorcery" sounds like hand-waving. Technical leaders want: "wrote a Python script to parse XML metadata." Don't hide the how.

**Needs "TL;DR" slide 0** - Executive wants summary upfront: "I fixed digital supply chains for Fox and Warner Bros. Here's how."

**Fuel TV / 2008 = ancient history** - Almost closed tab at "Flash." Consider starting with big wins or summary.

**Movie titles don't matter** - Corpse Bride/Watchmen don't help. Volume/metrics do.

**Role clarity problem** - Recruiter can't slot you: PM? Ops Director? Lead Dev? The "box" is unclear.

**$1.5M = most memorable** - Executive will remember this 5 minutes later. Nothing else.

### Overlapping Themes (Both Models Agree)
1. ⚠️ SDI section drags
2. ⚠️ Missing team size/management scope
3. ⚠️ AI section too vague
4. ⚠️ Missing tech stack keywords
5. ⚠️ Ending needs harder CTA

---

## REVISION NOTES (from prototype testing - January 25, 2026)

### ⭐ BIG IDEA: Variable Speech Pacing (Future Enhancement)
Instead of uniform word timing, **choreograph the reading experience like a spoken performance:**
- Group natural phrases as single fragments ("It's 2008." appears together)
- Fast pacing for rapid-fire lists, slower for dramatic moments
- Per-word `data-autoslide` values: quick words (100-150ms), normal (225ms), punchlines (400-600ms)
- Example: "So I did." gets a long pause before appearing for impact

**This transforms the presentation from "words appearing" to "a performance unfolding."**

---

### Beat 2: Flash Joke - Pacing Fix
**Current:** "We delivered in Flash." → "Yep." (auto-reveals together)
**Change:** "Yep." should require its own click for comedic timing (punchline pause)

### Beats 8-10: Warner Bros Section - Dialogue Rewrite
Make it feel more like actual dialogue/in-the-moment:

**Beat 8 (transition):**
- Current: "📞" → "Hey, it's Warner Bros."
- New: "📞" → "Hello, Tyler? It's Warner Bros."

**New beat after 8:**
- "We have a problem..."

**Beat 9 adjustment:**
- Current: "iTunes was rejecting 68% of their film deliveries."
- New: "iTunes is rejecting 68% of our film deliveries."

**Beat 10 adjustment:**
- Current: "Castilian Spanish audio for Corpse Bride got sent to Watchmen."
- New: "We sent Castilian Spanish audio for Corpse Bride to Watchmen."

### Beat 18: SDI Transition - Dialogue Rewrite
**Current:** "SDI Media came looking for the iTunes guy." → "They found me."
**New:** "Hello, iTunes guy? This is SDI Media."

### Beat 19: SDI Scale - Add Line
**Current ends with:** "Hundreds of files a day, dragged and dropped by hand."
**Add after (same slide):** "Dozens of points of failure."

### Beat 25: Fox Transition - Personal Anecdote
**Current:** "📞" → "Fox came calling."
**New (two beats):**
- Beat 25a: "📞" → "Hello, Tyler? It's Fox. What's your favorite symphony?"
- Beat 25b: "You're hired!"

*Context: Real interview question - Tyler answered Beethoven's 3rd (the Eroica), which changed the course of all music after it.*

### Beat 26: Fox Scale - DOUBLE MEANING 🎵
**Current:** "Fox was a different scale."
**Opportunity:** "Scale" = business size AND musical term! Perfect callback to symphony question.
- Could lean into this with visuals (musical staff? crescendo imagery?)
- The word "scale" lands differently now - intentional double meaning
- Eroica (3rd Symphony) was known for its MASSIVE scale compared to anything before it

### Beat 32: Disney - Dramatic Split (Separate Slides)
**Current:** "Then Disney happened." (one slide)
**New (two slides):**
- Beat 32a: "Then..."
- Beat 32b: "Disney happened."

**Rationale:** Separate slides > same slide here. Disney was a SEISMIC moment - it deserves its own slide landing with full impact. The blank pause after "Then..." builds maximum tension.

### Beats 35-36: Emmy Fake-Out 🎭
**Current:**
- Beat 35: "It worked."
- Beat 36: "We won an Emmy." → "My name's on my trophy."

**New (comedic misdirect):**
- Beat 35: "It didn't work."
- Beat 36: "Just kidding, we won an Emmy." → "My name's on my trophy."

**Why it works:** Quick subversion of expectations. Reader thinks "oh no" for one beat, then immediate payoff. Adds personality and humor without undercutting the real achievement.

### Beat 38: Fox Platforms - Rewrite + "You're Welcome"
**Current:** "Fox Nation needed a CMS. Built it." → "100 episodes ready on launch day." → "Then the new Fox content distribution platform." → "Team across 10 countries." → "Launched Fox Weather."

**New (reorganized):**
- Beat 38a: "Fox Nation needed a CMS. Built it. 100 episodes ready on launch day."
- Beat 38b (new slide): "Then, I got to help Fox build a new content distribution platform." → "From scratch. Teams across 10 countries." → "Launched Fox Weather."
- Consider adding: "You're welcome!" (same slide as Fox Weather, or its own beat for comedic timing)

**Decision:** "You're welcome!" on its own slide. Bigger laugh, confident energy.

### Beat 39: Building How to Build - Own Slide + Reword
**Current (same slide):** "I wasn't just building platforms anymore." → "I was building how we build."

**New (split):**
- Beat 39a: "I wasn't just building platforms anymore."
- Beat 39b (own slide): "I was building how TO build."

**Reword rationale:** "how TO build" > "how we build"
- "how we build" = Fox-specific
- "how TO build" = universal methodology, positions Tyler as thought leader

### Beat 40: The Pattern - Confident Reframe
**Current:** "Every company had the same problem." → "Content operations that couldn't scale." → "I knew how to fix it."

**New (split + reword):**
- Beat 40a: "Every company had the same problem." → "Content operations that *COULD* scale..."
- Beat 40b (new slide): "...but needed me to fix it."

**Why this works:** Reframes from "broken things I fixed" to "potential I unlocked." Confident without arrogance.

### Beat 41: New Media Redux - Split for Punchline
**Current (same slide):** "In 2008, they called it 'New Media.'" → "Nobody knew the rules yet." → "I figured them out anyway."

**New (split):**
- Beat 41a: "In 2008, they called it 'New Media.'" → "Nobody knew the rules yet."
- Beat 41b (own slide): "I figured them out anyway."

**Why:** The punchline lands harder alone. Confident mic-drop energy.

### Beat 43: AI Impact - Deliberate Pacing
**Current:** "AI is changing everything about content." → "How we create it. How we scale it. How we deliver it."

**Change:** Add deliberate pauses between the three phrases:
- "How we create it." [pause]
- "How we scale it." [pause]
- "How we deliver it." [pause]

**Implementation:** Each phrase as its own fragment with longer `data-autoslide` (400-500ms) - rhythmic, almost poetic delivery.

### Beats 44-45: Watching vs Building - Emphasis
**Current:**
- Beat 44: "Most people are watching."
- Beat 45: "I'm building." → "Built a content intelligence platform from scratch." → "AI-powered. Serving traffic."

**Change:** Give "I'm building." its own moment:
- Beat 44: "Most people are watching."
- Beat 45 (own slide): "I'm building."
- Beat 46: "Built a content intelligence platform from scratch." → "AI-powered. Serving traffic."

**Why:** The contrast "watching" → "building" is the defiant heart of the story. "I'm building." alone is a statement of identity, not just activity.

### Beat 48: Browser Tabs Callback - Explicit Reference
**Current:** "A million browser tabs later..." → "Half those platforms are dead."
**New:** "A million browser tabs later..." → "Half those platforms from earlier are dead."

**Why:** Makes the bookend callback to the opening (47 tabs, MySpace, etc.) more explicit.

### Beat 49: Final Line - Deliberate Closing
**Current:** "Figuring things out is still mandatory." → "That's the best part." (auto-reveals together)

**Change (same slide, special pacing):**
- "Figuring things out is still mandatory." (normal reveal)
- [significant pause OR require click]
- "That's the best part." - OPTIONS:
  1. Require click to reveal (user chooses when to see the payoff)
  2. Word-by-word with long delays: "That's... the... best... part." (500ms+ per word)

**Recommendation:** Option 1 (click to reveal) - lets the reader sit with "mandatory" before getting the twist that you LOVE it. The click becomes them asking "...and?" and you answering.

### End Slide: CTA Decision (Depends on Placement)
**Current:** "→ tylergohr.com" (link to homepage)

**Problem:** If story lives ON tylergohr.com, this is redundant.

**Options based on final placement:**
1. **Story = homepage hero** → No end slide needed. End on "That's the best part." Clean.
2. **Story = /story page** → CTA like "Let's talk →" (links to /contact) or "See my work →" (/case-studies)
3. **Story = embedded component** → Contextual next action

**Decision:** TBD based on where story ultimately lives. For now, keep placeholder or remove entirely.

---

## TEXT POSITIONING DESIGN DECISION

### Consistent Anchor Point
**Default position:** Left-center (left side of screen, vertically centered)
- First word of every slide starts at the same X,Y coordinate
- Additional lines stack below
- Reader always knows where to look

### Exception: Punchy Statements
Short emphatic lines can break pattern and go **centered**:
- "I'm building."
- "You're hired!"
- "That's the best part."
- etc.

**Why this works:** Center is still predictable (middle of screen). The pattern break becomes a SIGNAL - "this moment is different/important." Reader learns: text is usually left, BIG moments are center.

### CSS Implementation
```css
/* Default: left-center anchor */
.beat-content {
  position: absolute;
  left: 10%;
  top: 50%;
  transform: translateY(-50%);
  text-align: left;
}

/* Exception: centered emphasis */
.beat-content.centered {
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  text-align: center;
}
```

### ⭐ Beat 22: Language List - ESCALATING EFFECT (Creative Enhancement)
**Vision:** Languages start slow, get faster and BIGGER - overwhelming cascade effect
**Techniques available:**
1. **Variable timing** - Each language gets shorter `data-autoslide`: 500ms → 400ms → 300ms → 200ms → 100ms → 50ms
2. **Growing text** - CSS `transform: scale()` increases with each language
3. **Reveal.js `grow` fragment** - Built-in scaling effect
4. **Custom CSS animation** - Combine speed + size + maybe screen shake at climax
5. **Possible climax** - Final languages MASSIVE, then "You get the idea." in tiny normal text (comedic release)

**This could be a signature visual moment in the presentation.**

### Beat 15: Sorcery - Dramatic Split
**Current:** "I went 'hmmm... alright, here's my plan.'" → "Then I began my sorcery."
**Change:** Split for dramatic pause:
- Beat 15a: "I went 'hmmm... alright, here's my plan.'" → "Then..."
- Beat 15b (new slide): "...I began my sorcery."
