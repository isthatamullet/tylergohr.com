**Visual notes:** Text starts normal speed/size. Each line faster timing (400ms→200ms→100ms→50ms) AND larger scale (1x→1.5x→2x→3x). Final "You get the idea" snaps back to small, normal - comedic release.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE (For Next Session)

### File to Update
`/home/user/tylergohr.com/src/app/story/page.tsx`

### Key Markers in This Script
- `[CLICK]` = Requires user click to reveal (not auto-advance)
- `[CLICK - own slide]` = This text is a separate slide entirely
- `(own slide)` in beat title = Entire beat is its own slide
- `[pause]` = Longer delay before this text (300-500ms instead of 190ms baseline)

### Beats That Need Centered Text (Exception to Left-Anchor)
- Beat 0: Hook (centered)
- Beat 35: "You're welcome!" (centered)
- Beat 42: "I'm building." (centered)
- Beat 47: "That's the best part." (centered)

### Special Implementation: Escalating Language Effect (Beat 17)
Requires custom CSS/JS:
1. Each language line is a fragment group
2. Timing decreases: 400ms → 200ms → 100ms → 50ms
3. Scale increases: transform scale(1) → scale(1.5) → scale(2) → scale(3)
4. Final line "You get the idea" snaps back to normal size/speed
5. Consider CSS keyframes or per-fragment data-autoslide + inline styles

### Special Implementation: Deliberate Pacing (Beat 40)
The three phrases need longer delays:
> "How we create it." [400ms pause]
> "How we scale it." [400ms pause]
> "How we deliver it." [400ms pause]

### Testing Checklist After Implementation
- [ ] All 48 beats render correctly
- [ ] Click-to-reveal beats pause properly
- [ ] Own-slide beats are separate slides
- [ ] Centered text beats are centered
- [ ] 190ms baseline pacing feels right
- [ ] Escalating effect works (if implemented)
- [ ] Back navigation smooth
- [ ] Mobile tap works
