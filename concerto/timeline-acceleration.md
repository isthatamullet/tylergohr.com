# Timeline Acceleration Updates

## URGENT: AI Industry Speed Reality Check

**Critical Context:** AI moves at breakneck speed. 6-12 month timelines are practically glacial in this space. If Google decides this is viable, we need to launch in weeks, not months, or risk being outdated by competitors.

**Key Rationale:**
- New AI models released every 2-3 months
- Big tech can copy concepts in 8-12 weeks  
- First-mover advantage measured in weeks, not months
- 92% of developers already using AI tools - market ready NOW

## **Implementation Priority: CRITICAL**

These timeline updates are **ESSENTIAL** for Google partnership credibility. The AI industry moves at startup speed, not enterprise speed. Showing Google we understand this velocity demonstrates:

1. **Market Awareness:** We understand AI competitive dynamics
2. **Execution Capability:** We can move at industry speed
3. **Opportunity Urgency:** The market window is NOW, not next year
4. **Partnership Value:** Google gets first-mover advantage with us

**Action Required:** Update all timeline references across both pages to reflect AI industry reality.
