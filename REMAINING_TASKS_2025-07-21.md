# Remaining Tasks - July 21, 2025

## Overview

After successfully simplifying the hooks system and updating CLAUDE.md, there are remaining documentation files that still reference the archived over-engineered systems. These need updates to reflect the current simple reality.

## High Priority Tasks (Start Here)

### üî• 1. Update CLAUDE-WORKFLOWS.md - Remove Complex Timeout Prevention Architecture

**File**: `/home/user/tylergohr.com/docs/CLAUDE-WORKFLOWS.md`
**Problem**: Contains extensive documentation about the archived orchestrator system
**Current Status**: 350+ lines describing complex timeout prevention, hooks integration, performance monitoring

**What Needs To Be Done**:
- Remove references to archived orchestrator system
- Remove complex hooks workflow integration details  
- Remove "üö® CLAUDE CODE: USE AGENT TOOL NOW" alert system (was dependent on archived hooks)
- Keep the valuable Agent tool patterns (Environment Setup, Test Execution, Timeout Prevention)
- Update to reflect simple npm commands approach
- Maintain guidance for Claude Code instances to use Agent tool for timeout-prone operations

**Expected Result**: Simplified guide focused on Agent tool usage without over-engineered automation

## Medium Priority Tasks

### üìù 2. Update Other Documentation Files With Outdated Hook References

**Files That May Need Updates**:
- `/home/user/tylergohr.com/docs/TESTING.md` - May reference archived screenshot automation
- `/home/user/tylergohr.com/docs/COMMANDS.md` - May reference archived hook commands
- `/home/user/tylergohr.com/docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - May reference archived hook debugging
- `/home/user/tylergohr.com/docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` - May reference archived automation workflows

**What To Look For**:
- References to orchestrator system
- Commands that call archived scripts
- Complex hook workflow descriptions
- Screenshot automation that was simplified
- Port management scripts that were archived

**What To Keep**:
- Basic file protection references (the 3 remaining files)
- Agent tool guidance for timeout prevention
- Simple npm command workflows
- Current testing patterns

## Completed Tasks (For Reference)

### ‚úÖ **Fixed Package.json Scripts**
- Removed calls to archived `subagent-integration.sh`
- Updated enhanced commands to call simple npm scripts
- All npm scripts now functional

### ‚úÖ **Rewrote docs/HOOKS.md**
- Complete rewrite reflecting simple file protection system
- Explains what was archived and why simple is better
- Documents current 4-6 second development workflow

### ‚úÖ **Updated CLAUDE.md Sub-Agent Section**
- Replaced 130 lines with 86 lines of focused guidance
- Removed references to archived orchestrator
- Maintained Agent tool patterns for timeout prevention

### ‚úÖ **Created Minimal Replacement Files**
- `scripts/hooks/lib/context-detection.sh` - 13 lines vs 375 lines
- Maintained working file protection system

## Current System State

### **What's Working**
```bash
# Fast development workflow
npm run typecheck && npm run lint    # 4-6 seconds
npm run validate                     # Complete validation
npx playwright test e2e/quick-screenshots.spec.ts --project=chromium  # Screenshots

# Optional file protection (currently disabled)
./scripts/hooks/install-hooks.sh     # Enable protection if wanted
./scripts/hooks/uninstall-hooks.sh   # Disable protection
```

### **What's Archived (Don't Document)**
- 3,925-line orchestrator system
- 1,728 lines of screenshot management  
- 513 lines of over-engineered context detection
- 15 port management scripts
- Complex visual workflow automation

## Documentation Update Strategy

### **For Each File**:
1. **Read the file** to understand current content
2. **Identify archived system references** that need removal
3. **Preserve valuable information** about Agent tool usage, testing patterns, etc.
4. **Update to reflect simple reality** (npm commands, optional file protection)
5. **Maintain Agent tool guidance** for timeout prevention

### **Key Principles**:
- **Remove complexity** - no more orchestrator references
- **Keep simplicity** - document the 4-6 second workflow
- **Preserve Agent tool guidance** - Claude should still use sub-agents for timeouts
- **Be accurate** - only document what actually exists and works

## User's Requirements (Keep These In Mind)

1. **"Claude should use sub-agents wherever possible"** ‚úÖ - Maintain in all documentation
2. **"Simple npm commands over complex automation"** ‚úÖ - Focus on npm run commands
3. **"Archive the over-engineered crap"** ‚úÖ - Remove references to archived systems
4. **Document current reality accurately** ‚úÖ - Only what actually works

## Success Criteria

### **When Documentation Update Is Complete**:
- ‚úÖ No references to archived orchestrator system in any documentation
- ‚úÖ All documented commands actually work with current system
- ‚úÖ Agent tool guidance preserved for timeout prevention
- ‚úÖ Simple development workflow clearly documented
- ‚úÖ Optional file protection accurately described

### **Testing Each Updated File**:
- Read through and verify no broken command references
- Ensure Agent tool patterns are maintained where relevant
- Confirm simple npm workflow is documented correctly
- Check that complexity was removed without losing value

## Next Session Workflow

### **Recommended Approach**:
1. **Start with CLAUDE-WORKFLOWS.md** (most complex, highest impact)
2. **Use the same pattern as CLAUDE.md**: Extract complex sections, revise, replace
3. **Update other docs** based on what's found in each file
4. **Test commands** mentioned in documentation to ensure accuracy
5. **Focus on accuracy over completeness** - better to have concise, working docs

### **Files To Have Open**:
- `SESSION_ACCOMPLISHMENTS_2025-01-21.md` (this session's work)
- `REMAINING_TASKS_2025-01-21.md` (this file)
- `docs/HOOKS.md` (example of good simple documentation)
- Current CLAUDE.md sub-agent section (example of clean Agent tool guidance)

**Status**: Ready for next session  
**Priority**: CLAUDE-WORKFLOWS.md cleanup  
**Goal**: Accurate documentation reflecting simple, working system  
**Preserve**: Agent tool guidance for timeout prevention
