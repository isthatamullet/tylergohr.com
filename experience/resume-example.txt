Personal Life
I know video content - I regularly watch / binge a whole lot of it. I'm an avid follower of political news and social issues, engaging with diverse sources to maintain a well-rounded perspective. I nerd out to space exploration, classical music, real estate, high quality digital content, looking up at the sky through my telescope, watching rockets launch, and exploring new places. I stay fit with regular gym visits, hiking, snowboarding, and eating healthy (mostly). I like very spicy food (and drinks). Free time involves hanging out with my two dear kitten siblings Harold and Louise, keeping most of my plants alive, learning through written and streaming educational content, and hot tub time with friends and neighbors. My most recently used emoji is üòç.
