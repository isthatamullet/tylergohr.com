New Media Specialist
Fuel TV (A Fox Cable Networks Action Sports Network) | 2008 - 2012
While at Fuel TV, I pioneered content distribution to dozens of partner platforms, such as Facebook, iTunes, YouTube, Hulu, and other global platforms. We implemented workflows to deliver video, artwork, metadata, and live streams for sports events and live concerts. I personally developed and enhanced the video players for our website, fuel.tv, along with launching and integrating custom video players for partner websites. I worked alongside show producers and directors to optimize our content for the emerging digital video world. While at Fuel TV I gained the foundational knowledge I would use at my other content distribution roles at the SDA church, SDI Media, Warner Bros, and Fox Corporation. Additionally while at Fuel TV, we saw our online viewership increase from a few thousand well into the millions. I also managed live editing for our worldwide sporting events streams, allowing segments of the live show to be published as the event unfolded. And finally, using data sources such as comScore, Nielsen Ratings, Adobe Analytics, and other metrics, I managed and performed reporting and data analysis for our content across all global platforms, providing actionable reports and insights.

PERSONAL LIFE

I'm an avid follower of political news and social issues, engaging with diverse sources to maintain a well-rounded perspective. I nerd out to space exploration, classical music, real estate, high quality digital content, looking up at the sky through my telescope, watching rockets launch, and exploring new places. I stay fit with regular gym visits, hiking, snowboarding, and eating healthy (mostly). Free time involves hanging out with my two dear kitten siblings Harold and Louise, killing over a dozen plants, learning through written and streaming educational content, and hot tub time with friends and neighbors. My most recently used emoji is 😍.
