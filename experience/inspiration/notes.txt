## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR /2 IMPLEMENTATION

### Suggested Visual Direction:
Based on "modern, colorful, professional, creative":

1. **Color System**: 
   - Keep your existing dark theme base
   - Add sophisticated gradients inspired by these templates
   - Integrate your current green/red accents strategically

2. **Creative Elements**:
   - Subtle 3D geometric elements (professional creativity)
   - Modern typography with bold hierarchy
   - Strategic use of vibrant accents

3. **Professional Foundation**:
   - Clean layouts that showcase enterprise experience
   - Clear service/capability presentations
   - Statistics and achievements prominently displayed

### Style Guide Location:
Based on your requirement for /2-specific styling that doesn't confuse with existing site:

```
/src/app/2/
├── styles/
│   ├── style-guide.md          # Visual brand guidelines
│   ├── components.module.css   # /2-specific component styles
│   └── brand-tokens.css        # Color, typography, spacing tokens
├── components/                 # /2-specific components if needed
└── layout.tsx                 # Already planned
```

This keeps all /2 branding completely separate from your current site.
