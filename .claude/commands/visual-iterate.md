# Visual Iterate - Visual Mock-Driven Development

Automate visual mock-driven development with screenshot comparison, iterative refinement, and integration with Tyler Gohr Portfolio's comprehensive Playwright visual testing infrastructure.

**Usage**: `/visual-iterate "UI feature description" [--mock=path/to/mockup.png] [--viewport=mobile|tablet|desktop|all] [--iterations=3] [--threshold=0.95]`

**For task**: $ARGUMENTS

## üöÄ Reliability-First Execution Strategy

**ALWAYS START HERE**: Determine the appropriate mode based on the user's request:

### **Mode 1: Quick Screenshots** (Default for simple requests)
- **Triggers**: "take screenshots", "show me", "capture current state", "how does X look"
- **Approach**: Use simplified screenshot generation for immediate visual review
- **Time**: 2-3 minutes, highly reliable
- **Output**: Mobile + Desktop screenshots of requested pages

### **Mode 2: Visual Development** (For iterative design work)  
- **Triggers**: "--mock=" parameter provided, "iterate", "compare with", "improve design"
- **Approach**: Full visual development workflow with mock comparison
- **Time**: 15-30 minutes, comprehensive analysis
- **Output**: Before/after comparisons, iterative improvements, production-ready code

### **Execution Order** (Reliability-First):
1. **Environment Check** ‚Üí Validate prerequisites & fix issues
2. **Mode Detection** ‚Üí Simple screenshots OR complex development
3. **Quick Success** ‚Üí Get screenshots working first  
4. **Progressive Enhancement** ‚Üí Add complexity only if requested

## Prerequisites & Environment Setup (Essential First Steps)

### **üîç Environment Validation & Auto-Setup**
Before attempting any screenshot generation, verify and setup the required infrastructure:

1. **Playwright Installation Check**:
   ```bash
   # Check if Playwright is installed and browsers are available
   npx playwright --version
   
   # If missing or browsers not installed, run setup:
   sudo npx playwright install-deps    # Install system dependencies
   npx playwright install              # Install browser binaries
   
   # Verify installation with a quick test:
   npx playwright test --help
   ```

2. **Dev Server Health Check**:
   ```bash
   # Check if dev server is running and responsive
   curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" --max-time 10 http://localhost:3000/2
   
   # If timeout or not running, restart dev server:
   pkill -f "next-server|npm run dev"  # Kill hung processes
   npm run dev &                       # Start fresh dev server
   
   # Wait for server to be ready before continuing
   ```

3. **Playwright Configuration Validation**:
   ```bash
   # Ensure headless mode is configured to avoid X server issues
   # Check playwright.config.ts has: headless: true
   
   # Test basic screenshot capability:
   npx playwright test --grep "simple" --project=chromium
   ```

### **üì∏ Quick Screenshot Mode (For Immediate Visual Review)**

When the request is simply "take screenshots" or "show me the current state", use this streamlined approach:

1. **Simple Screenshot Test Creation**:
   ```typescript
   // Create: e2e/quick-screenshots.spec.ts
   import { test } from '@playwright/test'
   
   test.describe('Quick Screenshots for Visual Review', () => {
     const pages = [
       '/2',                    // Homepage
       '/2/case-studies',       // Case Studies  
       '/2/how-i-work',         // Process
       '/2/technical-expertise' // Technical Skills
     ]
     
     const viewports = [
       { name: 'mobile', width: 375, height: 667 },
       { name: 'desktop', width: 1200, height: 800 }
     ]
   
     for (const route of pages) {
       for (const viewport of viewports) {
         test(`${route.replace('/2/', '') || 'homepage'} - ${viewport.name}`, async ({ page }) => {
           await page.setViewportSize(viewport)
           await page.goto(route)
           await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle')
           await page.waitForTimeout(1000) // Brief settle
           
           const filename = `${route.replace('/2/', '') || 'homepage'}-${viewport.name}.png`
           await page.screenshot({ 
             path: `screenshots/quick-review/${filename}`,
             fullPage: true 
           })
         })
       }
     }
   })
   ```

2. **Quick Execution Command**:
   ```bash
   # Fast, reliable screenshot generation (2-3 minutes)
   npx playwright test e2e/quick-screenshots.spec.ts --project=chromium
   
   # Results in: screenshots/quick-review/*.png
   ```

### **üõ†Ô∏è Common Issues & Auto-Recovery**

**Issue 1: Playwright Dependencies Missing**
```bash
# Symptoms: libgtk-4.so.1 errors, browser launch failures
# Fix:
sudo npx playwright install-deps
npx playwright install
```

**Issue 2: Hung Dev Server** 
```bash
# Symptoms: Timeouts on /2 route, curl timeouts
# Fix:
pkill -f "next-server|npm run dev"
npm run dev &
sleep 5  # Wait for startup
```

**Issue 3: X Server/Display Issues**
```bash
# Symptoms: "Missing X server or $DISPLAY" errors
# Fix: Ensure playwright.config.ts has headless: true
# Or use: DISPLAY=:99 xvfb-run npx playwright test
```

**Issue 4: Complex Tests Timing Out**
```bash
# Symptoms: screenshot-generation.spec.ts fails with timeouts
# Fix: Use simple mode instead
npx playwright test e2e/quick-screenshots.spec.ts --project=chromium
```

### **üéØ Mode Detection & Execution Strategy**

**Simple Requests** (just want to see current state):
- "take screenshots of [pages]"
- "show me how [page] looks"  
- "capture the current design"
‚Üí **Use Quick Screenshot Mode**

**Complex Requests** (visual development/iteration):
- "compare against this mockup"
- "iterate on this design"
- "comprehensive visual analysis"
‚Üí **Use Full Visual Iterate Workflow**

### **Step-by-Step Execution for Screenshot Requests**

**When user requests screenshots (e.g., "take screenshots of /2's detail pages"):**

1. **First, ALWAYS run environment checks:**
   ```bash
   # Check dev server health
   curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" --max-time 10 http://localhost:3000/2
   
   # If not 200, fix dev server:
   pkill -f "next-server|npm run dev" && npm run dev &
   ```

2. **For simple screenshot requests, use Quick Mode:**
   ```bash
   # Create screenshots/quick-review directory if needed
   mkdir -p screenshots/quick-review
   
   # Run quick screenshot test (2-3 minutes, reliable)
   npx playwright test e2e/quick-screenshots.spec.ts --project=chromium
   
   # Display results from screenshots/quick-review/*.png
   ```

3. **Only use complex modes when specifically requested:**
   - User provides a mock image: Use full visual development workflow
   - User asks for "comprehensive analysis": Use advanced testing
   - User wants "iteration": Use comparison features

### **Failure Recovery Pattern**

If quick screenshots fail:
1. **Check Playwright setup:**
   ```bash
   sudo npx playwright install-deps
   npx playwright install
   ```

2. **Verify headless configuration:**
   ```bash
   # Ensure playwright.config.ts has: headless: true
   ```

3. **Try even simpler approach:**
   ```bash
   # Create a basic one-off test if needed
   npx playwright test --grep "single test" --project=chromium
   ```

### **Success Indicators**
- ‚úÖ Screenshots generated in 2-3 minutes
- ‚úÖ Files appear in screenshots/quick-review/
- ‚úÖ Both mobile and desktop versions captured
- ‚úÖ User can immediately see visual results

**Remember:** The goal is to make "take screenshots" requests **just work** quickly and reliably, not to run comprehensive visual testing unless specifically requested.
