  The screenshot test is failing because the development server isn't running. Let me start the dev server first and 
  then take a more targeted screenshot. I need to get the server running and then capture the before state.

  The dev server is starting on port 3005 instead of 3000. That's fine. Let me wait a moment for it to fully start and
   then take a simple screenshot to capture the current text display.

● Good! The dev server is running on port 3005. Let me take a quick screenshot of the current case studies page to
  capture how the text displays now:


wasn't our dynamic port system created to avoid these port issues?







Phase 4: Validate Text Display & Run Quality Gates

  Now let me manually check that the text displays correctly by testing the case studies page, and then run the
  quality gates:

● Bash(curl -s "http://localhost:3005/2/case-studies" | grep -o "couldn.*t\|don.*t\|won.*t" | head -3)
  ⎿  Error: Command timed out after 30s

✻ Thinking…

  The curl is timing out. Let me check if the dev server is still running and then proceed with the quality gates 
  since we know this is a very low-risk change:

● Let me run the quality gates to ensure everything is working properly:

● Bash(npm run validate)
  ⎿  Interrupted by user

> why did you use a localhost URL when you should have used a google URL?

● You're absolutely right! I should be using the Google Cloud Workstation URL, not localhost. In cloud workstations,
  the development server is accessible via the .cloudworkstations.dev domain.

  Let me correct this and check the text display properly:

● Bash(echo $GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT)
  ⎿  (No content)

● Bash(curl -s "https://3005-cs-${USER}-default-${HOSTNAME}.cloudworkstations.dev/2/case-studies" | grep -o
      "couldn.*t\|don.*t\|won.*t" | head -3)
  ⎿  No (tell Claude what to do differently)

> isn't the dynamic port system working? the URL should look like one of the active preview URLs listed in vscode 
  ports console

● You're absolutely right! I should be checking the VS Code ports console to see the actual preview URL that's been
  dynamically assigned. The dev server is running on port 3005, and there should be a preview URL available in the
  ports panel.

  Let me check what ports are actually forwarded:

● Bash(lsof -i :3005)
  ⎿  Error: Error

● Bash(ps aux | grep "next dev")
  ⎿ user       39440  0.0  0.4 11529716 73576 ?      Sl   01:13   0:00 node /home/user/tylergohr.com/node_modules/.bin

    … +18 lines (ctrl+r to expand)



● I see multiple Next.js processes running. You're correct that I should be using the actual VS Code ports preview
  URL. Since you can see the active ports in your VS Code interface, could you share what the correct preview URL is?
  It should be something like https://[generated-url].cloudworkstations.dev that VS Code shows in the ports panel for
  port 3005.

  For now, let me complete the validation by running the quality gates:

● Bash(npm run validate)

> hang on - you said 'the test' is using localhost:3000 instead of the preview URL - can you identify exactly which 
  test is using that?

● Read(e2e/quick-screenshots.spec.ts)
  ⎿  Read 145 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Yes, I can see exactly which test is using localhost:3000. The test file e2e/quick-screenshots.spec.ts is using
  relative routes like /2, /2/case-studies, etc. at lines 29, 66, 88, 110, and 132.

  The issue is that Playwright is using a base URL configuration that points to http://localhost:3000, but the server
  is actually running on port 3006. Let me check the Playwright configuration:

● Search(pattern: "playwright.config.*")
  ⎿  Found 1 file (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(playwright.config.ts)
  ⎿  Read 80 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Found it! The Playwright config at line 21 has this baseURL setting:

  baseURL: process.env.ACTIVE_DEV_URL || `http://localhost:${process.env.ACTIVE_DEV_PORT || '3000'}`

  So the test is using the environment variables ACTIVE_DEV_URL or ACTIVE_DEV_PORT to determine the base URL. Since
  neither is set, it defaults to localhost:3000, but the server is running on port 3006.

  I need to set the environment variable to use the preview URL:

● Bash(ACTIVE_DEV_URL=https://3006-tylergohr.cluster-cbx7armcmnaqcxcx5fojjql2bo.cloudworkstations.dev npx playwright

> sorry to stop you - i think you need to add /2 at the end of the url - try that and run the command again

✻ Thinking…

  The user is right - I need to add /2 at the end of the URL since that's the route for the redesigned portfolio. The 
  preview URL should be the full URL to the /2 route.

● You're absolutely right! I need to add /2 at the end of the URL since that's the route for the redesigned portfolio.
