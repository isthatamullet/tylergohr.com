please update visual-iterate.md so claude code knows to install playwright dependencies when needed

kick off sub agents to address each of the following:
1. research actual standard UX best practices from FAANG style companies and b2c SaaS giants and grade our implementation against it
2. check out our style guide and ensure our app conforms to it, screen by screen, kicking off sub agents for each screen
3. research performance optimization for Expo and see how our app structure can be optimized further
4. use the context7 mcp to check out relevant, up to date documentation on (topic or tool) and build a plan (but don't implement) and place the results in a new scratchpad .md doc


so do these new hooks get invoked automatically, or do i need to do anything different when prompting claude code so the hooks are invoked?
